        STAGE 1 : e-VIVA (there are few sets, please don't expect same
        questions, it may vary) <br />
        20 questions (MCQ, MSQ, NAT) - 30 min They asked questions from EDC,
        BJT, Apti, communication, and almost all subjects covered. <br />
        <br />
        STAGE 2 : INTERVIEW <br />
        Introduce yourself. Design a system such that, if a person is walking in
        a corridor, the lights should turn on in the direction of moment of the
        person and cross questions on this, like what are the sensors we can
        use, how your system works if there are 2 persons, and how the system
        works if the 2 persons are moving in opposite direction at the same time
        and many more cross questions to the system you design. Draw the diode
        I-V characteristics in semilog paper i.e, log(I) vs V, diode equation
        There are a total of 6 panels (for DESE department A to F). The
        interview totally depends on the panel you get. If you are going to give
        an interview for EPD, do prepare Embedded systems basic concepts. Few
        Questions asked to the fellow students : (collectively for MVLSI, ESE,
        EPD, IAP, ECE) More stressed and cross questions in the project Draw the
        output voltage waveform of the NMOS whose input is a square pulse.
        Register banks Graphs like sinx/x, x+sinx, x-sinx, y=(x-3)(x+5)(x),
        xsinx. Period of sin^2(x) and sinx^2 and whether periodic or not. Basic
        questions on Mos capacitors and band diagrams. Some questions on remote
        desktop, TCP IP, UDP, and computer networks related. Gave a very lengthy
        equation and asked to draw the graph - the expression can be simplified
        using Taylor series or some expansion it seems. These are all I could
        recall My suggestions : Be thorough with your btech project (most panels
        are asking but not all) Better to come very early and register at the
        department entrance and go for e-VIVA Ask your fellow students about the
        questions they faced. So that you can have an idea on the level of the
        questions and toughness of the panel. Carry a water bottle and be calm
        before the interview. Luck factor also plays a huge role here.
